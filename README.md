# Adaptive-RAG-with-Feedback-Loop

# 🔥 Project Overview

Enterprises handle huge amounts of unstructured documents (contracts, reports, notes, etc.).

A traditional Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) system retrieves relevant context from these documents and generates answers.

But what if the answer is wrong or incomplete?

👉 Adaptive RAG solves this by integrating a feedback loop:

✔️ After every answer, a user can provide feedback (mark correct/incorrect, add corrections).

✔️ The system refines future responses by learning from this feedback.

Adaptive_RAG_with_feedback_loop.ipynb

💡 Jupyter notebook containing:

1) VectorStore class – stores docs and embeddings.

2) FeedbackStore class – stores user feedback.

3) AdaptiveRAG class – main pipeline combining retrieval
  
4) A simple main() demo.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)
  • Retrieves top‑k documents from a vector store using cosine similarity.

✅ Feedback Loop
  • Stores user feedback (query, response, corrections).
  • Integrates relevant past feedback to refine new responses.

✅ Adaptive Behavior
  • Refines answers over time as more feedback is collected.

# 🛠 Future Improvements

🔹 Replace dummy random embeddings with real embeddings (e.g., sentence-transformers).

🔹 Integrate with a real LLM (OpenAI, HuggingFace) for generate_response.

🔹 Enhance feedback matching using semantic similarity instead of simple substring match.
